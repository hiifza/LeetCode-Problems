## 🧠 About This Repository

This repository documents my personal journey of solving problems on **LeetCode**.

It is more than a collection of solutions —  
it reflects structured thinking, pattern recognition, optimization strategies, and continuous growth in Data Structures & Algorithms.

Every problem solved contributes toward building deeper algorithmic intuition.

## 🏗 Repository Structure


Each problem follows a clean and scalable format:

Problem-Number-Problem-Name/


Inside each folder:

- 💻 Source code implementation  
- 🧩 Clear logical breakdown  
- ⏱ Time and space complexity analysis (where applicable)  
- 📝 Optional explanations for deeper clarity  

The structure is intentionally minimal and scalable to support long-term growth.
